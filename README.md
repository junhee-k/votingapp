# Flutter Project GitHub Collaboration Guide

## 1. Repository Setup
- Use the provided GitHub repository: [VotingApp Repository](https://github.com/junhee-k/votingapp.git)
- Ask the repository owner to add you as a **Collaborator** under "Settings" ‚Üí "Manage Access".

## 2. Cloning the Repository
Each team member should:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/junhee-k/votingapp.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd votingapp
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

## 3. Branching & Workflow
- Always work in a separate branch.
- Use meaningful branch names, e.g., `feature-login-screen`.
- Avoid working directly on `main`.

### Creating a New Branch
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```
- Creates a new branch and switches to it.

### Making Changes
1. Modify files.
2. Stage changes:
```sh
git add .
```
3. Commit changes:
```sh
git commit -m "Describe the change"
```
4. Push the branch to GitHub:
```sh
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

## 4. Pull Requests (PR) and Feature Merging Process
### Creating a Pull Request (PR)
- Once your feature branch is ready for review, go to the repository on GitHub.
- Click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
- Click **New Pull Request**.
- Select your branch as the source and `main` as the target.
- Add a title and description for your changes.
- Click **Create Pull Request**.

### Reviewing a Pull Request
1. Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the PR that needs to be reviewed.
3. Review the code changes:
   - Use **Files changed** to see modifications.
   - Add comments on specific lines if needed.
   - Check for best practices and correctness.
4. Approve or request changes:
   - Click **Review changes**.
   - Choose **Approve** if the changes are good, or **Request changes** if modifications are needed.
   - Leave a comment summarizing your review.
   - Click **Submit review**.

### Merging a Pull Request into `main`
- Once the PR is approved, click **Merge pull request**.
- Choose **Squash and merge** (if commits need to be combined) or **Merge commit** (to keep commit history).
- Click **Confirm merge**.
- Delete the feature branch after merging by clicking **Delete branch**.
- Pull the latest changes to your local `main` branch:
  ```sh
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  ```

## 5. Code & Commit Guidelines
- Follow Flutter's best practices.
- Keep commit messages clear and concise.
- Example commit messages:
  - ‚úÖ "Fixed UI bug in login screen"
  - ‚ùå "Update main.dart"

## 6. Common Git Commands Explained
- Check branch:
  ```sh
  git branch
  ```
  - Lists all branches in the repository.
- Switch branches:
  ```sh
  git checkout branch-name
  ```
  - Moves to the specified branch.
- Pull latest changes:
  ```sh
  git pull origin main
  ```
  - Updates the local branch with the latest remote changes.
- Merge a branch into `main`:
  ```sh
  git checkout main
  git merge feature-branch-name
  git push origin main
  ```
  - Combines changes from the feature branch into `main`.

## 7. Handling Merge Conflicts
- If Git shows a merge conflict, open the conflicting file and manually resolve it.
- After resolving, run:
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
  git push origin main
  ```

## 8. Additional Tips
- Keep your branches updated (`git pull origin main`).
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files.
- Use **issues** and **project boards** for task management.

Happy coding! üöÄ
